Silverlight 2 is out now with new features like rich set of controls, improved Text Rendering capabilities, rich networking support including calling secured(SSL) services etc...

Moreover Microsoft is partnered with [Soyatec](http://www.soyatec.com/) to sponsor tools for developing Silverlight applications using cross platform Eclipse development platform. [eclipse2SL][1] is first of that kind.

[eclipse2SL][1] is an open source tools integrated with the Eclipse development platform that enable Java developers to use the Eclipse platform to create applications that run on the Microsoft Silverlight runtime platform. Specifically, the project will be an Eclipse plug-in that works with the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) to provide both a Silverlight development environment and greater interoperability between Silverlight and Java, to facilitate the integration of Silverlight-based applications into Java-based web sites and services.

As an addition to the control set Microsoft is releasing Silverlight Toolkit by end of this month with more UI controls.
