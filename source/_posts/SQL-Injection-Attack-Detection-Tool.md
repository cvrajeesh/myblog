Today I found a tool called **Scrawlr** that will help you to detect **SQL injection** loop holes in your web application. I hope it will be a good add-on to your archery against security attacks.

For those who don't know what is SQL injection â€“

>SQL injection is a technique that exploits a security vulnerability occurring in the database layer of an application. The vulnerability is present when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and thereby unexpectedly executed. It is in fact an instance of a more > general class of vulnerabilities that can occur whenever one programming or scripting language is embedded inside another.
