For the last couple of years I was using wordpress as my blogging platform, it is an awesome framework but finally I decided to move away from it and created my own blog engine(Rhyble), on which this blog is running now.

[Rhyble] is built using Asp.Net MVC3, NHiberanate and it is running Appharbor

You might ask why I want reinvent the wheel again because we have many blog engines available today. Jeff Atwood answered that question here - [Why does every man and his dog want to code a blogging engine?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/471940/why-does-every-man-and-his-dog-want-to-code-a-blogging-engine/471944#471944)

These were my objectives when I started creating Rhyble

1. Focus on the most important functionalities, doesn’t want to create another wordpress with truck full of unwanted things
2. Improve the performance. Now I have [YSlow](http://yslow.org/) rating of 94 compared to 65

3. I didn’t wanted to go through the existing blog engines code base, which is more time consuming than creating a new one

More over it is a nice feeling if you have something you own. Now I have platform of my own and next things should be blogging frequently.

That’s it for the day.
