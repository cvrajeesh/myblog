My name is Rajeesh C V, a software developer and also founder of [Clodui](https://www.clodui.com).

I have been writing code for living for more than a decade. In early days of my carrier I was working in Microsoft technologies, but later decided not to stick onto a particular technology or stack. Now a days, I am working on technologies spanning from serverless to frontend.

These are the technologies I have been using for the past couple of years

- Python
- Node.js
- React
- AWS
- Serverless

I share my thoughts in my blog [rajeeshcv.com](https://www.rajeeshcv.com) and you can reach me at twitter [cvrajeesh](https://twitter.com/cvrajeesh)
